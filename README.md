304 Chimps :D


## 1. A completed cover page
## 2. A brief (half-page or paragraph) project description answering these questions:
- What is the domain of the application?  Describe it.
- What aspects of the domain are modeled by the database?
    - The domain of the application is fitness. That is, we're going to focus on the data that is stored about aspects of a recreation centre ranging from membership accounts, programs offered, and building setup (i.e. weight rooms, gyms, etc.)


## 3. Database specifications: (3-5 sentences)
- What benefit does the database provide to the application?
    - The recreation facilitates the recreation centre using entities and relationships. The database will have hierarchies (ISA hierarchy) and several relationships (weak entity relationships, various cardinalities) to accurately and efficiently represent the types of data and relationships within the recreation centre. 

- What functionality will the database provide?
    - Allows for easier management of the different components of a recreation center.
    - Offers a potential template for other cities to use in their own recreation centers as most facilities share at least some common features.

## 4. Description of the application platform: (2-3 sentences)
- What platform will your project use?
    - This project will be done using the CPSC department's MySql database system, using PHP
- What is your expected application technology stack?
    - We will use PHP to create and manage the SQL database. 

- You  can  change/adjust  your  tech  stack  later  as  you  learn  more  about  how  to  get 
started  for  the  project  via  latter  tutorials  in  the  course  regarding  SQL*Plus/Oracle, Java/JDBC, PHP, etc.   The coding is expected to start later on.


## 5. An ER diagram for the database that your application will use.
- Your ER diagram needs to meet the aforementioned requirements, e.g., 7 entity sets, and so on. It is OK to hand-draw it but if it is illegible or messy or confusing, marks will be taken off.  You can use software to draw your 
diagram (e.g., draw.io, GoogleDraw, Microsoft Visio, Gliffy, maybe Word, etc.) The result should be a legible PDF or PNG document.  Note that your ER diagram must use the conventions from the textbook and the lectures (but no crowâ€™s feet notation or notation from other textbooks).
